**Gold Miner**
### Description
Design an intelligent agent that simulates a Miner  on a rectangular grid of nxn squares. We set n to be from 8 to 64.  The starting point for the Miner is always the square 1,1, on the upper left-hand corner of the grid, at row 1 and column 1. Somewhere on the grid is a unique golden square that contains the POT OF GOLD.  The agent finds its way to the golden square, and the shorter the path travelled, the more rational is the agent.

### Two levels
    * Level R (Random): the miner makes random (but valid) moves, and wanders about the grid until it accidentally trips on the golden square.
    * Level S (Smart): the agent is smart that finds the “best” move given the current configuration. You can have memory of the past moves.
